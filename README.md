This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I'll review the codebase and provide a comprehensive report on the current functionality, along with a list of files containing placeholder information.

## 2. Files with Placeholder Information

### Images and Assets
- All image references use placeholder paths that don't exist in the repo:
  - `/images/products/*.jpg`
  - `/images/payment/*.svg`
  - `/placeholder.svg`, `/images/hero.jpg`

### Mock Data
1. **src/lib/data/products.ts**: 
   - Contains mock product data for the entire site
   - All product images are placeholders

2. **src/hooks/useHook.ts**:
   - Contains sample product data that's used as a fallback

3. **src/app/api/products/route.ts** and **src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts**:
   - Mock product database instead of real database queries

4. **src/app/checkout/success/page.tsx**:
   - Generates random order numbers and totals
   - Mock order date (current date)

### Authentication
5. **src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts**:
   - Hard-coded test user credentials
   - Empty Google provider credentials

### API Routes
6. **src/app/api/checkout/route.ts**:
   - Stripe implementation is a skeleton without real implementation
   - Environment variables referenced but not likely configured

7. **src/app/api/contact/route.ts**:
   - Logs to console instead of saving to database or sending emails

### Components with Placeholders
8. **src/app/about/page.tsx**:
   - Team member information is hardcoded
   - Images use placeholder references

9. **src/app/page.tsx** (Home page):
   - Testimonials are hardcoded
   - Newsletter form has no backend functionality

10. **src/components/Footer.tsx**:
    - Social media links are empty
    - Payment method images reference non-existent files

11. **src/app/contact/page.tsx**:
    - Store address and contact info are placeholders

12. **src/components/Navigation.tsx**:
    - Search functionality is not implemented despite UI elements being present
    - Account page link exists but the page isn't implemented

### Styling Inconsistencies
13. **tailwind.config.ts**:
    - Defines a green and brown theme but the site primarily uses blue theme colors

In conclusion, the SkinGlow website has a solid foundation with most of the frontend user flow implemented, but lacks integration with real backend services and contains numerous placeholder elements that would need to be replaced with actual content before deployment.
